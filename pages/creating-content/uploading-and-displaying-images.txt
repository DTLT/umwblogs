#Uploading and Displaying Images

Whether you are uploading an image directly to WordPress, or embedding an image located on the web, the Media Library is responsible for organizing and managing all images. 

==== Accessing the Media Library ====

[{{ :creating-content:visual-editor.png?nolink |}}]

//While editing a post:// Click **Add Media** to embed existing images or to upload a new image to be embedded. This is the primary method for accessing the Media Library, as it allows you to both upload an image and place it in a post/page at the same time.

[{{ :creating-content:media-library.png?nolink |}}]

//From the dashboard:// Go to **Media -> Library** to view images you've already uploaded, or **Media -> Add New** to upload new images. This method is useful for uploading images you want to use later.

==== Uploading Images to the Library ====

**Using an Image from the Web**

[{{ :creating-content:insert-from-url.png?nolink&600 |}}]

From the post/page editor, click **Add Media**, then **Insert from URL**. Enter the direct URL to the image you want to embed (the URL will normally end in .jpg or .png), enter a title, and click **Insert into Post**. Note that images embedded in this way are not actually stored in your Media Library; if the images are removed from the original storage location by the owner, they will no longer appear on your blog. Think carefully before choosing this method! Consider only using this method with images you control, e.g. images stored in your own Flickr account.

**Using an Image from Your Computer**

Click **Add Media** from the post/page editor to go to the Upload Files tab of the Media Library. When uploading files, you may either drag and drop images into marked section of the browser window, or click **Select Files** to find the images you want to upload on your computer. Pay attention to the current maximum upload file size limit, and make sure each image you upload is below the designated limit.

**Using a Previously-Uploaded Image**

If you would like to re-use an image you have previously uploaded to your WordPress Media Library, simply click **Media Library**, find the image you want to use, and click on it. 

==== Setting Image Options ====

1)  After successfully uploading your image or selecting it from the Media Library, you will have the opportunity to enter additional details about the image, and to set display settings. The most important of the text-based details are the:
  * //Caption//, which should contain copyright / licensing information about the image, and the
  * //Alt Text//, which will be displayed if a person's browser cannot display images, or if a person is using a screen reader to access your blog. If you do not enter Alt Text for your images, screen readers could potentially get stuck and be unable to load the rest of your blog.

You may also wish to enter text into the Description field, and whether or not this is displayed will depend on what theme you are using. Each of these text fields accepts basic HTML (e.g. anchor tags to create links). 

2)   Under Attachment Display Settings, there are three drop-downs that provide you with some options about how the image is displayed:
  * //Alignment//: whether the image is justified to the left, right, or center
  * //Link to//: where a visitor is taken when they click on the image. This can be useful if you are embedding a very large image that cannot be displayed at full size within the post/page you are creating; if you set this option to **Media File**, visitors can click on the embedded image to see a full-size version. If you are not embedding an image that needs to be viewed at full size, you can prevent the image from being clickable by setting this option to **None**.
  * //Size//: whenever you upload an image, the WordPress Media Library automatically generates copies of the image at standardized sizes. Pick which version should be embedded into your post/page; the optimal size depends on your theme, but usually 600px or less is a good place to start.

3)  When you are finished, click **Insert Into Post/Page** to continue editing your post/page.

==== Changing Image Options ====

You can make changes to your image after you've embedded it by clicking on the image in the post/page editor. When you do this, you
