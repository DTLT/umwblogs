#Copyright and Attribution Best Practices

When writing a paper, it's important to provide credit to the writers, researchers, academics, and others who influenced your thinking, or whose words you have used. This is usually done through the use of footnotes, endnotes, and/or bibliographies. It's just as important to provide credit to creators of images, audio, video, and other kinds of media you have used or remixed, especially on an open and highly-trafficked publishing platform like UMW Blogs.

==== Aren't I Protected by Fair Use? ====

"Fair use" refers to guidelines that allow portions of copyrighted works to be used for educational purposes without prior permission from the rightsholder(s). Fair use rights are not actually protected by law; they are a set of guidelines agreed to by publishers, academics communities, and others, but they are not officially codified as part of the US Copyright Act of 1976.

As a result, fair use guidelines are at times vaguely defined, and it can often be difficult for a layperson without a law degree to determine where exactly the boundary between fair and unfair use lies. Stanford University's [[http://fairuse.stanford.edu/|Copyright and Fair Use website]] does a great job of providing in-depth details about fair use for those who are interested. Even if you are not interested in the particulars, it's important to understand that fair use provides a limited number of protections within a limited number of contexts. 

Also, consider that the last major update to US copyright law was the 1998 passage of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act|Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. For context, that happened:
  * One year before [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster|Napster]] (1999)
  * Six years before [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook|Facebook]] (2004)
  * Six years before [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr|Flickr]] (2004)
  * Seven years before [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube|YouTube]] (2005)

In short, US copyright law is outdated in many ways, and fair use probably does not provide the breadth of protection you think it does.

==== A Simplified Guide to Copyright ====

Before getting started, there are some questions you can ask yourself to determine whether it would be appropriate for you to use a particular piece of media on your blog. Consider the following flowchart:

This flowchart is not intended to summarize or to provide guidance related to all use cases. It is meant to help you visualize the most basic questions you should be asking before using media on your blog. In simplifying that process, it necessarily glosses over some of the complexities inherent to copyright and attribution. For example:
  * **Making work from scratch is different than editing or remixing work that others have created.** You automatically have the right to use any work you have created from scratch. If you want to make something new based on work others have created, you need to make sure you have permission to reuse and remix each individual piece.
  * **Determining who owns the rights to a particular media object can be tricky.** When you find media on the web, it's not always clear exactly what the original source is, and therefore who has the authority to say under what conditions and in what contexts a particular media object may be used. Unattributed text can often be found via Google and other popular search engines, and [[https://www.tineye.com/|TinEye]] provides a reverse search that can help identify where a particular image originated. For video and audio, it may be impossible to determine the original source, and you may have to proceed without that information.
  * **Permission can be sought, and granted, in many different ways.** For example, you can research a media object to determine whether it is in the public domain. (Given the way our copyright system works, this is more likely for historical objects.) If you can determine the creator of the work, you can contact them directly to explain what you want to do and ask if it's okay. Some creators label and distribute their works with licenses that explicitly state what individuals are permitted to with their work, and what the conditions of that permission are.
