You can create your own VoiceThread with any of the following media:

  * An image from your computer
  * A video from your computer
  * A document from your computer
  * A media file from one of the integrated **Media Sources** (like Flickr)
  * An image from a URL&nbsp;
  * A video directly from a webcam on your computer

In this example, we've uploaded an image from our computer to get started:

You can repeat the media upload/add process as many times as you need until you've completed building your VoiceThread.

(NOTE: At any point, you can add a title to your VoiceThread by clicking **(Add a title and a description)** above the Media Uploader.)

Once you've completed building your VoiceThread, you can add your own comments to any of the media to get things started. Simply click the **Comment** button, and you'll be presented with a preview of your VoiceThread. On any of the slides in your VoiceThread, click the white **Comment** button.
