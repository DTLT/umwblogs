Here is an example of how the columns will appear on your timeline.

You can navigate the timeline by using the arrow keys, clicking on each event, the arrows on the sides of the slide currently in view, or by dragging the time line at the bottom.


**A few tips and common problems:**

  * The time line will not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline.
  * Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
  * For the Headline you must include something in the "Text" Field. It will show up as subtext under the Headline.
  * You do not need to fill the cells for: "End date”, “Media”, “Media Credit”, “Media Caption”, or “Media Thumbnail”.
* Watch out for blank rows, your timeline will stop wherever that Blank row occurs and any slide after will not appear. 
* The standard date format is: xx/xx/xxxx -- Month / Day / Year
  * You can change this format by selecting the entire “Start Date”, “End Date”, or both columns. Then click the “Format” tab, put your mouse over “Number” at the top, and then select “Plain text” at the bottom of the drop down menu. Now you can have just a year, or a year and month, etc. as 1908, 06/1998
