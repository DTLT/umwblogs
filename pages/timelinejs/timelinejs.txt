Follow the Instructions on their webpage

Download the Google Drive Spreadsheet Template.

Save a copy of their spreadsheet and fill out the spreadsheet within information for your timeline.



A few tips:

  * The time line will not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline.
  * Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
  * For the Headline you must include something in the "Text" Field. It will show up as subtext under the Headline.
  * You do not need to fill the cells for: "End date”, “Media”, “Media Credit”, “Media Caption”, or “Media Thumbnail”.
  * he standard date format is: xx/xx/xxxx -- Month / Day / Year
  * You can change this format by selecting the entire “Start Date”, “End Date”, or both columns. Then click the “Format” tab, put your mouse over “Number” at the top, and then select “Plain text” at the bottom of the drop down menu. Now you can have just a year, or a year and month, etc. as 1908, 06/1998

  * Watch out for blank rows, your timeline will stop wherever that Blank row occurs and any slide after will not appear.
