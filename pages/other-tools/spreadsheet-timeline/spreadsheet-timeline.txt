#Spreadsheet Timeline

TimelineJS is a web-based tool that takes entries from a Google Spreadsheet and displays them visually on a timeline. This tool has been used to create timeline covering topics like the  [[http://taipingcivilwar.org/timeline|Taiping Civil War]], the [[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/timeline-egypt-inturmoil0.html|Crisis in Egypt]], and the [[http://world.time.com/2013/12/05/nelson-mandelas-extraordinary-life-an-interactive-timeline/|Life of Nelson Mandela]].

====Access the Template====

1)  Go to [[http://drive.google.com|Google Drive]] and sign in with your Google username and password. If you don't already have a Google account, you will need to [[https://accounts.google.com/signup|create one]].

2)  From the Google Drive [[http://drive.google.com/templates|Templates gallery]], search for UMW, and find the Spreadsheet Timeline template your course is using. If there is not a customized template for your specific course, use the template called "UMW Spreadsheet Timeline." You can also find [[other-tools:spreadsheet-timeline:spreadsheet-timeline|a list of customized templates]] on this wiki.

3)  Once you have found the right template, click the "Use this template" button, and the template will be copied into your Google Drive account. When it is done copying, the template will be opened in your browser and you can begin working immediately.

====Embedding in WordPress====

In order to view your timeline, you will need to first publish the spreadsheet you are using to contain its data, and also to embed the timeline display code into a website (in this case, a post or page on UMW Blogs or another WordPress-based site).

You only need to complete these steps once for each timeline you create; after you have published and embedded the timeline into a website, any changes you make to the spreadsheet will automatically (although not instantaneously) be populated into the timeline on your site.

1)  In your spreadsheet, click on "File" at the top, then "Click publish to the Web"

2)  Another window will pop up. Make sure the box labeled "Automatically republish when changes are made" is checked, and click "Start Publishing."

3)  In the bottom of that window, copy the URL that appears under "Get a link to the published data." Be sure you copy the entire link -- you may need to expand the box to get the whole URL.

4)  Go to the [[http://timeline.knightlab.com|TimelineJS website]], scroll down to the "Make a Timeline" section, and find Step 3. Paste the URL you copied into the box. You can use the "More Options" drop-down menu to make custom changes, but for most people the default options are acceptable.

5)  Scroll down to Step 4 on the TimelineJS website. Clicking the Preview button will show you what your timeline will look like. (At this point you may not have customized the template at all, but it's still useful to preview to make sure you have completed all of the steps up to this point properly.) Copy the code provided to your computer's clipboard.

6)  To embed this timeline into UMWBlogs (or another WordPress site), first create a new post or page to contain the embedded timeline, then switch the WordPress editor from Visual to Text mode. 

7)  Paste the code from the TimelineJS website into the WordPress editor, then publish your page or post. Your timeline should appear embedded into the post, and any changes you make in the spreadsheet should automatically be updated here. (Note that it may take a few minutes for changes on the spreadsheet to appear on the timeline; while the process is automatic, it is not instantaneous. Be patient!)




===== Spreadsheet Columns =====

**Start and End Date:** The standard date format is: xx/xx/xxxx -- Month / Day / Year


Make sure to put the dates in chronological order, the Timeline will not work well if it needs to jump around the timeline to out of order dates.

**Headline:** This is where you can put a the title of the event.

**Text:** Here is where you can type blocks of text to describe this specific event, try to keep it short and just summarize the event.

Important note: For the Title slide, by default it is the first row, the text in the cell will appear as a sub-title text and you must include it.

**Media:** This is where you can add a link to your multimedia such as a picture, website, YouTube video, Vimeo Video, Google map, a Flickr photo, a Twitter tweet, SoundCloud, and a Block Quote.

For a block quote use "<blockquote>" before the text and "</blockquote>" at the end of the text.

**Media Credit:** Here You can put a credit of who or where the photo came from.

**Media Caption:** Here you can write a caption to describe your photo.

**Media Thumbnail:** This is where you can add an additional link to a photo so that that a small image will appear in the timeline to represent that slide. 

**Type:** This is where you can decide wether your slide is an standard slide, a title side, or an era, by selecting options from the drop down in the cell; blank, title, era, respectively.

Using Title Type: The first "Slide" is by default set to be the title slide. If you select the title type for a slide other than the first slide, all slides before it will not be shown.

How to use the Era Type: By selecting the Era option will Timeline will not show anything in the other fields, it will simply add an orange box and name to the timeline below to show events happening in an Era. It will name your era with whatever is in the respective Headline column cell. 

====Tips and Tricks====

  * Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
  * For the Headline you must include something in the "Text" Field. It will show up as subtext under the Headline.
  * You do not need to fill the cells for: "End date”, “Media”, “Media Credit”, “Media Caption”, or “Media Thumbnail”.
  * Watch out for blank rows, your timeline will stop wherever that Blank row occurs and any slide after will not appear.
  * You can add additional rows at the bottom of the spreadsheets for more events. You will need to expand the formatting of your cells above by grabbing the right corner of the cell and dragging it down the column to your new rows. You can also use the format painter brush as well to expand the formatting. 
  * Visitors to your site can navigate the timeline with the arrow keys on their keyboard, by clicking on an event tab in the timeline slider, by clicking the arrows on either side of the slide currently displayed on the timeline, and/or by dragging the slider.
