#Spreadsheet Timeline

TimelineJS is a web-based tool that takes entries from a Google Spreadsheet and displays them visually on a timeline. This tool has been used to create timeline covering topics like the  [[http://taipingcivilwar.org/timeline|Taiping Civil War]], the [[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/timeline-egypt-inturmoil0.html|Crisis in Egypt]], and the [[http://world.time.com/2013/12/05/nelson-mandelas-extraordinary-life-an-interactive-timeline/|Life of Nelson Mandela]].

====Access the Template====

1)  Go to [[http://drive.google.com|Google Drive]] and sign in with your Google username and password. If you don't already have a Google account, you will need to [[https://accounts.google.com/signup|create one]].

2)  From the Google Drive [[http://drive.google.com/templates|Templates gallery]], search for UMW, and find the Spreadsheet Timeline template your course is using. If there is not a customized template for your specific course, use the template called "UMW Spreadsheet Timeline." You can also find [[other-tools:spreadsheet-timeline:spreadsheet-timeline|a list of customized templates]] on this wiki.

3)  Once you have found the right template, click the "Use this template" button, and the template will be copied into your Google Drive account. When it is done copying, the template will be opened in your browser and you can begin working immediately.

3)  In the bottom of that window, copy the URL that appears under "Get a link to the published data." Be sure you copy the entire link -- you may need to expand the box to get the whole URL.

4)  Go to the [[http://timeline.knightlab.com|TimelineJS website]], scroll down to the "Make a Timeline" section, and find Step 3. Paste the URL you copied into the box. You can use the "More Options" drop-down menu to make custom changes, but for most people the default options are acceptable.

===== Spreadsheet Columns =====

**Start and End Date:** The standard date format is: xx/xx/xxxx -- Month / Day / Year


Make sure to put the dates in chronological order, the Timeline will not work well if it needs to jump around the timeline to out of order dates.

**Headline:** This is where you can put a the title of the event.

**Text:** Here is where you can type blocks of text to describe this specific event, try to keep it short and just summarize the event.

Important note: For the Title slide, by default it is the first row, the text in the cell will appear as a sub-title text and you must include it.

**Media:** This is where you can add a link to your multimedia such as a picture, website, YouTube video, Vimeo Video, Google map, a Flickr photo, a Twitter tweet, SoundCloud, and a Block Quote.

For a block quote use "<blockquote>" before the text and "</blockquote>" at the end of the text.

**Media Credit:** Here You can put a credit of who or where the photo came from.

**Media Caption:** Here you can write a caption to describe your photo.

**Media Thumbnail:** This is where you can add an additional link to a photo so that that a small image will appear in the timeline to represent that slide. 

**Type:** This is where you can decide wether your slide is an standard slide, a title side, or an era, by selecting options from the drop down in the cell; blank, title, era, respectively.

Using Title Type: The first "Slide" is by default set to be the title slide. If you select the title type for a slide other than the first slide, all slides before it will not be shown.

How to use the Era Type: By selecting the Era option will Timeline will not show anything in the other fields, it will simply add an orange box and name to the timeline below to show events happening in an Era. It will name your era with whatever is in the respective Headline column cell. 

**Important Notes:**

* Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
* For the Headline you must include something in the "Text" Field. It will show up as subtext under the Headline.
* You do not need to fill the cells for: "End date”, “Media”, “Media Credit”, “Media Caption”, or “Media Thumbnail”.
* Watch out for blank rows, your timeline will stop wherever that Blank row occurs and any slide after will not appear.
* You can add additional rows at the bottom of the spread sheets for more events. You will need to expand the formatting of your cells above by grabbing the right corner of the cell and dragging it down the column to your new rows. You can also use the format painter brush as well to expand the formatting.

* From there paste that link in to The timeline JS's Step 3 where it says "Google spreadsheet URL." You will most likely not need to change any of the other settings

{{:timelinejs:step_3.png?600|}}

* A the bottom you can either preview your timeline on the same webpage or you can click "Link to Preview" and view it in another page
* As a final step you can grab the code in Timeline JS's step four to embed into your website or blog.

**Important Note:** The "Automatically Republish" function does not always work immediately after you have made changes. You may have to go back into that window and manually republish your timeline if you want to see your most recent changes.

==== Adding Timeline to WordPress ====


  * Create a new post
  * Change the editor from "Visual" to "Text," if you do not change the this then the editor will paste the link literally and not interpret it as code
