#Spreadsheet Timeline (aka TimelineJS)

TimelineJS is a web-based tool that takes entries from a Google Spreadsheet and displays them visually on a timeline. This tool has been used to create timeline covering topics like the  [[http://taipingcivilwar.org/timeline|Taiping Civil War]], the [[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/timeline-egypt-inturmoil0.html|Crisis in Egypt]], and the [[http://world.time.com/2013/12/05/nelson-mandelas-extraordinary-life-an-interactive-timeline/|Life of Nelson Mandela]].

To use TimelineJS, you must first have a Google account. If you do not already have one, please visit [[http://accounts.google.com|the Google sign-in]] page, and follow the link to create an account.

===== Spreadsheet Columns =====



**Start and End Date:** The standard date format is: xx/xx/xxxx -- Month / Day / Year

You can change this format by selecting the “Start Date” column, “End Date” column, or both columns. Then click the “Format” tab, put your mouse over “Number” at the top, and then select “Plain text” at the bottom of the drop down menu. Now you can have just a year, or a year and month, etc. as 1908, 06/1998

Make sure to put the dates in chronological order, the Timeline will not work well if it needs to jump around the timeline to out of order dates.

**Headline:** This is where you can put a the title of the event.

**Text:** Here is where you can type blocks of text to describe this specific event, try to keep it short and just summarize the event.

Important note: For the Title slide, by default it is the first row, the text in the cell will appear as a sub-title text and you must include it.

**Media:** This is where you can add a link to your multimedia such as a picture, website, YouTube video, Vimeo Video, Google map, a Flickr photo, a Twitter tweet, SoundCloud, and a Block Quote.

For a block quote use "<blockquote>" before the text and "</blockquote>" at the end of the text.

**Media Credit:** Here You can put a credit of who or where the photo came from.

**Media Caption:** Here you can write a caption to describe your photo.

**Media Thumbnail:** This is where you can add an additional link to a photo so that that a small image will appear in the timeline to represent that slide. 

**Type:** This is where you can decide wether your slide is an standard slide, a title side, or an era, by selecting options from the drop down in the cell; blank, title, era, respectively.

Using Title Type: The first "Slide" is by default set to be the title slide. If you select the title type for a slide other than the first slide, all slides before it will not be shown.

How to use the Era Type: By selecting the Era option will Timeline will not show anything in the other fields, it will simply add an orange box and name to the timeline below to show events happening in an Era. It will name your era with whatever is in the respective Headline column cell. 

**Important Notes:**

* Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
* For the Headline you must include something in the "Text" Field. It will show up as subtext under the Headline.
* You do not need to fill the cells for: "End date”, “Media”, “Media Credit”, “Media Caption”, or “Media Thumbnail”.
* Watch out for blank rows, your timeline will stop wherever that Blank row occurs and any slide after will not appear.
* You can add additional rows at the bottom of the spread sheets for more events. You will need to expand the formatting of your cells above by grabbing the right corner of the cell and dragging it down the column to your new rows. You can also use the format painter brush as well to expand the formatting.
